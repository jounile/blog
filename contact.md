Hi there =)

I am a software engineer from Finland, currently living in Germany and working in the automotive industry.
My greatest asset is technical problem-solving skills and I aspire to improve teamwork by effective communication. 

Developing applications and tools is my passion and outside work assignments I love to implement cloud based solutions. I have been providing technical consulting to some non-profit organizations as long as I have been programming because I believe this is the best way to learn new technologies in real environments while also doing some good and helping others. 

Feel free to contact me if you think I could be of help in a project for a great cause.
