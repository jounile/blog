Hi there =)

I am a software engineer from Finland. Currently I live in Germany and work in the automotive industry.
My greatest asset is technical problem solving skills and I aspire to improve teamwork by effective communication. 

Developing applications and tools is my passion and outside work assignments I love to implement cloud based solutions. In fact I have been providing technical consulting to companies & non-profit organizations throughout my professional life. I believe this is the best way to learn new technologies in real life environments while also doing some good and helping others. 

Feel free to contact me if you think I could be of help in a project for a great cause.
