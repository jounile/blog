International Motor Show in Frankfurt was a blast!

The weather was nice and sunny and it was nice to eat and drink outside. Food trucks were placed between the exhibition halls and around the car parkour track. There nearly ten enormous halls so the walking distances between brands were long.  

BMW augmented reality show was truly memorable. A large screen was placed next to a vehicle that was augmented right before the eyes of the audience. 

Porsche Taycan was highlighted in multiple places. Porsche had also a theatre like multimedia show on a big screen.

Audi had a rather traditional display despite a couple of special vehicles drawing a lot of attention.

Mercedes exhibition was a clear winner in my eyes. The whole building had a special atmosphere and the visualizations were great.

Exhibition price was very reasonable 17 eur for a day ticket during the weekend. Buying online via IAA app included a 2 eur discount.
