International Motor Show in Frankfurt was a blast!

I visited the IAA on the second last day of the exhibition. The weather was nice and sunny. Perfect for eating outside. They had food trucks placed between the exhibition halls. In the center was a dangerous looking parkour track for cars where one could take a ride with a professional driver who would put the vehicles through tilted lanes and steap climbs. 
The area consisted of nearly ten enormous halls so the walking distances between brands were long.  

BMW augmented reality show was truly memorable. A large screen was placed next to a vehicle that was augmented right before the eyes of the audience. 

Porsche Taycan electric car was highlighted in multiple places. Porsche had also a theatre like multimedia show on a big screen and a small accessories shop where you could buy Porche brand gear.

Audi had a rather traditional display despite the A1 hanging on a wall and a couple of special vehicles that were drawing a lot of attention.

Mercedes exhibition was a clear winner in my eyes. Their whole building had a special atmosphere and the visualizations on countles screens were great.

Exhibition price was very reasonable 17 eur for a day ticket during the weekend. Buying online via IAA app included a 2 eur discount.

Next year we will definately gather a bigger crew and have a company trip there.
