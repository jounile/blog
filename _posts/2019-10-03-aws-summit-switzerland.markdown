<h3>Keynote</h3>

The keynote from Ian Massingham included some news and insights of the current state with Amazon Web Services.
I gathered the most interesting topics on this blog post and also shared it with my colleagues in realtime.
Here we go.

Amount of Windows workloads on AWS is rather surprising.

Lambda integrates with 47 other services.

AWS has learned from their customers that majority of infrastructure cost for doing Machine Learning comes from inference, not training.

Therefore there has been some recent development to reduce costs.
Notice the pre-announcement of a new service AWS Inferentia.

AWS benefits from Amazon’s long heritage on Machine Learning and the technology coming from these lessons learned is now available also for AWS customers.

AWS IoT services has quite a growth. New services and feature additions are comprehensive.

Pretty good keynote with customer stories in my opinion.

<h3>Swisscom</h3>

Not often I come across such interesting presentation about security. 

At Swisscom you can request for an AWS account for your project via online form. After automated provisioning the sub-account will instantly become monitored by their Security team.
Some custom setup with AWS Organizations to allow project accounts, sandboxes and centralized services.

Great demo of creating a project template with Serverless Architecture (including authentication, CI/CD pipeline and monitoring)
Services introduced here were AWS Amplify, CodeStar, AWS CDK, X-Ray.

Sanity check against customer requirements.

Homegate AG shared their experiences on re-architecting a real estate platform. 
70% of their develop time was spent on bug fixing a monolith. Asking around at conferences everyone was pointing them towards Kubernetes. Security was the main reason for them for going Serverless.

Finally I want to leave you with advice from one of the customers presenting in the event.

"Don´t get locked up into avoiding lock-in"
